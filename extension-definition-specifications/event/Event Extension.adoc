[.stix-doc-information-heading]*Abstract:*

The current STIX 2.1 Incident object exists as a stub in the hopes that future work would allow STIX Incidents to be more fully fleshed out using extensions, and that in time a set of core features could be defined to be migrated into a future version of the Incident object or the community could arrive at the consensus to continue to use these extensions.

This extension is focused on recording attacker, defender, and other related activities that occur during an incident and prior to an incident being declared.
This extension also provides both new means and examples of connections to a number of existing STIX Objects in order to facilitate highly interoperable verbose reporting that does not overburden analysts to initially generate or maintain.

== 1. Events in STIX

Events represent things that have ocurred or are expected to occur that could impact an organization.
Events can store a list of sub-events that can be optionally ordered to provide greater fidelity.
Events often take place prior to an incident being declared, and events with impacts or suspected impacts often lead to incidents being created.

|*status* (required)
|[stixtype]#event-status-enum#
|The current status of the event.

|*type* (required)
|[stixtype]#string#
|The value of this property *MUST* be set to [stixliteral]#event#.

|*changed_objects* (optional)
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#state-change#
|A list of changes that this event has caused.
This is typically used to indicate how an event has affected impacts.

|*description* (optional)
|[stixtype]#string#
|A description of event that occurred.

|*end_time* (optional)
|[stixtype]#timestamp#
|The date and time the event was last recorded. If this is not present it is assumed to be unknown.

|*end_time_fidelity* (optional)
|[stixtype]#timestamp-fidelity-enum#
|The level of fidelity that the end_time is recorded in.
This value *MUST* come from [stixtype]#timestamp-fidelity-enum#.

If no value is provided the timestamp should be considered to be accurate up to the number of decimals it includes.

|*event_types* (optional)
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#open-vocabulary#
|High level types for the event in order to enable aggregation and summaries.
This should be drawn from event-type-ov.

|*goal* (optional)
|[stixtype]#string#

Not all events have goals.

|*kill_chain_phases* (optional)
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#kill-chain-phase#

In these cases it is appropriate to have the Sighting use the Event itself as its *sighting_of_ref*.

|*start_time* (optional)
|[stixtype]#timestamp#
|The date and time the event was first recorded. If this is not
present it is assumed to be unknown.

This property *SHOULD* be populated.

accurate up to the number of decimals it includes.

|*subevents* (optional)
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#event-sequence#
|A list of sub-event that this event was composed of.

|*sequence_start* (optional)
|[stixtype]#integer#
|An optional sequence number starting at 0 that shows the earliest point this event is believed to have occurred relative to other [stixtype]#event-sequence# entries in the same list.

This *MUST NOT* exceed the [stixtype]*sequence_end* value, but the two can be equal.

=== 2.2 State Change Object Type

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#state-change#

The *initial_ref* or *result_ref* *MUST* be populated.

[width="100%",cols="37%,23%,40%",options="header",]

^|[stixtr]*Property Name*
^|[stixtr]*Type* 
^|[stixtr]*Description*

|*state_change_type* (required)
|[stixtype]#open-vocabulary# 
|How this activity influenced the change in state between the *initial_ref* and *result_ref*.

This *SHOULD* be drawn from [stixtype]#state-change-type-ov#.

|*initial_ref* (optional)
|[stixtype]#identifier#
|The initial object state that this event affected.

If the *result_ref* is not populated then this *MUST* be populated.
If there is no result state this typically means that this event removed or resolved the initial object.
For example, an event or task resolved a network outage.

If both are present this indicates a transition between these states.
For example, a confidentiality impact was made worse as the information was shared further.

If the *result_ref* is populated this *MUST* reference the same type of SDO.

|*result_ref* (optional)
|[stixtype]#identifier#
|The final state that this event influenced.

If the *initial_ref* is not populated then this *MUST* be populated.
If there is no initial state it typically means that this event caused or created the result.
For example, an event causing a network outage.

If the *initial_ref* is populated this *MUST* reference the same type of SDO.
