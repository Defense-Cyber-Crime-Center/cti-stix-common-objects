== Identity Contact Information Extension Version 1.0 for STIX™ Version 2.1
Draft

3 January 2023

Editors:: Jeffrey Mates

Additional artifacts:: This prose specification is one component of a Work Product that also includes:
* STIX™ Version 2.1 - OS

Related work:: This specification replaces or supersedes:
* N/A

Abstract:: The current STIX 2.1 Identity object only contains a single text field for contact information.  This is insufficient to effectively move contact information for individuals between automated systems.  This extension adds more granular tracking so that this can be effectively communicated between systems.
