[.stix-doc-information-heading]*Abstract:*

STIX 2.1 currently provides no means of sharing information about the impact of incidents.
In the 1.0 version of the core incident extension these details were embedded into the Incident SDO.
Based on the various implementation efforts it was determined that it would be best to split this information into a separate SDO.
Doing so allows for easier sharing of information using TAXII as data markings can be safely applied to each impact so that native filtering capabilities can be used to limit dissemination of sensitive information reducing re-authoring requirements that were present in the 1.0 version of the core incident extension.


This extension is intended to be pair with both the Incident Activity and Incident extensions to allow for in depth information sharing.
This extension uses the ID `extension-definition--7cc33dd6-f6a1-489b-98ea-522d351d71b9`.


== 1. Impacts in STIX

Incident objects represent events that have occurred and require further consideration or investigation.
The Incident object should have sufficient properties to represent the current state of the Incident with respect to impact to the enterprise.
For example, an incident may (or may not) have an impact that justifies the cost of immediate remediation or mitigation.

The incident core extension exists to allow a whole lifecycle approach for Incident response, reporting and tracking throughout its entire lifecycle while also allowing this information to be easily queried against at scale by systems that exchange STIX 2.1 Incident data.

== 3.0 Impact Extensions

The Impact SDO is currently an extension, but as there are many specific types of impacts with their own unique properties it emulates the File SCO through the use of STIX Extensions to provide the granular details of specific categories of impacts.
As such every Impact *MUST* have an extension that has the same value of the *impact_category*.
This allows consumers to quickly validate their ability to process this category of impact and then load all of its specific details.

Producers *SHOULD* use one of the extensions  not be used by different impact detail objects.
The following is a list of impact detail objects that *SHOULD* be used.
