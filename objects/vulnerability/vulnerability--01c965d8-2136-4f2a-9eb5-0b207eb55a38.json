            "description": "This vulnerability exists in Philips lighting devices due to storage of Wi-Fi credentials in plain text within the device firmware. An attacker with physical access could exploit this by extracting the firmware and analyzing the binary data to obtain the plaintext Wi-Fi credentials stored on the vulnerable device.\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Wi-Fi network to which vulnerable device is connected.",
