            "description": "The Hueman theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.6.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_meta_box() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save metabox data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
