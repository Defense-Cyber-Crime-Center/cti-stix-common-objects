            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: fix a crash if ->get_sset_count() fails\n\nIf ds->ops->get_sset_count() fails then it \"count\" is a negative error\ncode such as -EOPNOTSUPP.  Because \"i\" is an unsigned int, the negative\nerror code is type promoted to a very high value and the loop will\ncorrupt memory until the system crashes.\n\nFix this by checking for error codes and changing the type of \"i\" to\njust int.",
