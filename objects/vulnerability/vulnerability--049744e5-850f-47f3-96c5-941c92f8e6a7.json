            "description": "The IEEE 802.11 standard sometimes enables an adversary to trick a victim into connecting to an unintended or untrusted network with Home WEP, Home WPA3 SAE-loop. Enterprise 802.1X/EAP, Mesh AMPE, or FILS, aka an \"SSID Confusion\" issue. This occurs because the SSID is not always used to derive the pairwise master key or session keys, and because there is not a protected exchange of an SSID during a 4-way handshake.",
