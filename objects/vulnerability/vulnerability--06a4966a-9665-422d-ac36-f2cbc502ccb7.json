            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: mediatek: mt8195: Add platform entry for ETDM1_OUT_BE dai link\n\nCommit e70b8dd26711 (\"ASoC: mediatek: mt8195: Remove afe-dai component\nand rework codec link\") removed the codec entry for the ETDM1_OUT_BE\ndai link entirely instead of replacing it with COMP_EMPTY(). This worked\nby accident as the remaining COMP_EMPTY() platform entry became the codec\nentry, and the platform entry became completely empty, effectively the\nsame as COMP_DUMMY() since snd_soc_fill_dummy_dai() doesn't do anything\nfor platform entries.\n\nThis causes a KASAN out-of-bounds warning in mtk_soundcard_common_probe()\nin sound/soc/mediatek/common/mtk-soundcard-driver.c:\n\n\tfor_each_card_prelinks(card, i, dai_link) {\n\t\tif (adsp_node && !strncmp(dai_link->name, \"AFE_SOF\", strlen(\"AFE_SOF\")))\n\t\t\tdai_link->platforms->of_node = adsp_node;\n\t\telse if (!dai_link->platforms->name && !dai_link->platforms->of_node)\n\t\t\tdai_link->platforms->of_node = platform_node;\n\t}\n\nwhere the code expects the platforms array to have space for at least one entry.\n\nAdd an COMP_EMPTY() entry so that dai_link->platforms has space.",
