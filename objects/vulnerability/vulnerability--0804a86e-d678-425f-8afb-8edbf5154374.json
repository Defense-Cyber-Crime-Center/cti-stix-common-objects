            "description": "A flaw was found in Keycloak that occurs from an error in the re-authentication mechanism within org.keycloak.authentication. This flaw allows hijacking an active Keycloak session by triggering a new authentication process with the query parameter \"prompt=login,\" prompting the user to re-enter their credentials. If the user cancels this re-authentication by selecting \"Restart login,\" an account takeover may occur, as the new session, with a different SUB, will possess the same SID as the previous session.",
