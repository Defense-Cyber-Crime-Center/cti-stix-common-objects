            "description": "Design document functions which receive a user http request object may expose authorization or session cookie headers of the user who accesses the document.\n\nThese design document functions are:\n  *    list\n  *    show\n  *    rewrite\n  *    update\n\nAn attacker can leak the session component using an HTML-like output, insert the session as an external resource (such as an image), or store the credential in a _local document with an \"update\" function.\n\nFor the attack to succeed the attacker has to be able to insert the design documents into the database, then manipulate a user to access a function from that design document.\n\nWorkaround: Avoid using design documents from untrusted sources which may attempt to access or manipulate request object's headers\n",
