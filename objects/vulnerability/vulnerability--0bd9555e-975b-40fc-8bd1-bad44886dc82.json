            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nserial: core: fix transmit-buffer reset and memleak\n\nCommit 761ed4a94582 (\"tty: serial_core: convert uart_close to use\ntty_port_close\") converted serial core to use tty_port_close() but\nfailed to notice that the transmit buffer still needs to be freed on\nfinal close.\n\nNot freeing the transmit buffer means that the buffer is no longer\ncleared on next open so that any ioctl() waiting for the buffer to drain\nmight wait indefinitely (e.g. on termios changes) or that stale data can\nend up being transmitted in case tx is restarted.\n\nFurthermore, the buffer of any port that has been opened would leak on\ndriver unbind.\n\nNote that the port lock is held when clearing the buffer pointer due to\nthe ldisc race worked around by commit a5ba1d95e46e (\"uart: fix race\nbetween uart_put_char() and uart_shutdown()\").\n\nAlso note that the tty-port shutdown() callback is not called for\nconsole ports so it is not strictly necessary to free the buffer page\nafter releasing the lock (cf. d72402145ace (\"tty/serial: do not free\ntrasnmit buffer page under port lock\")).",
