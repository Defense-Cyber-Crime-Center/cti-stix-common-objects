            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvhost_vdpa: assign irq bypass producer token correctly\n\nWe used to call irq_bypass_unregister_producer() in\nvhost_vdpa_setup_vq_irq() which is problematic as we don't know if the\ntoken pointer is still valid or not.\n\nActually, we use the eventfd_ctx as the token so the life cycle of the\ntoken should be bound to the VHOST_SET_VRING_CALL instead of\nvhost_vdpa_setup_vq_irq() which could be called by set_status().\n\nFixing this by setting up irq bypass producer's token when handling\nVHOST_SET_VRING_CALL and un-registering the producer before calling\nvhost_vring_ioctl() to prevent a possible use after free as eventfd\ncould have been released in vhost_vring_ioctl(). And such registering\nand unregistering will only be done if DRIVER_OK is set.",
