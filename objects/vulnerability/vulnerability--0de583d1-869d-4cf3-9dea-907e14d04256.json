            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nefistub/tpm: Use ACPI reclaim memory for event log to avoid corruption\n\nThe TPM event log table is a Linux specific construct, where the data\nproduced by the GetEventLog() boot service is cached in memory, and\npassed on to the OS using an EFI configuration table.\n\nThe use of EFI_LOADER_DATA here results in the region being left\nunreserved in the E820 memory map constructed by the EFI stub, and this\nis the memory description that is passed on to the incoming kernel by\nkexec, which is therefore unaware that the region should be reserved.\n\nEven though the utility of the TPM2 event log after a kexec is\nquestionable, any corruption might send the parsing code off into the\nweeds and crash the kernel. So let's use EFI_ACPI_RECLAIM_MEMORY\ninstead, which is always treated as reserved by the E820 conversion\nlogic.",
