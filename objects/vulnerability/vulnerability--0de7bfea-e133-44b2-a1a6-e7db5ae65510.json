            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/alternatives: Disable KASAN in apply_alternatives()\n\nFei has reported that KASAN triggers during apply_alternatives() on\na 5-level paging machine:\n\n\tBUG: KASAN: out-of-bounds in rcu_is_watching()\n\tRead of size 4 at addr ff110003ee6419a0 by task swapper/0/0\n\t...\n\t__asan_load4()\n\trcu_is_watching()\n\ttrace_hardirqs_on()\n\ttext_poke_early()\n\tapply_alternatives()\n\t...\n\nOn machines with 5-level paging, cpu_feature_enabled(X86_FEATURE_LA57)\ngets patched. It includes KASAN code, where KASAN_SHADOW_START depends on\n__VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT, which is defined with cpu_feature_enabled().\n\nKASAN gets confused when apply_alternatives() patches the\nKASAN_SHADOW_START users. A test patch that makes KASAN_SHADOW_START\nstatic, by replacing __VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT with 56, works around the issue.\n\nFix it for real by disabling KASAN while the kernel is patching alternatives.\n\n[ mingo: updated the changelog ]",
