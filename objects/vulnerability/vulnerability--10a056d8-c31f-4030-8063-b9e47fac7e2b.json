            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/mdp5: Return error code in mdp5_pipe_release when deadlock is detected\n\nmdp5_get_global_state runs the risk of hitting a -EDEADLK when acquiring\nthe modeset lock, but currently mdp5_pipe_release doesn't check for if\nan error is returned. Because of this, there is a possibility of\nmdp5_pipe_release hitting a NULL dereference error.\n\nTo avoid this, let's have mdp5_pipe_release check if\nmdp5_get_global_state returns an error and propogate that error.\n\nChanges since v1:\n- Separated declaration and initialization of *new_state to avoid\n  compiler warning\n- Fixed some spelling mistakes in commit message\n\nChanges since v2:\n- Return 0 in case where hwpipe is NULL as this is considered normal\n  behavior\n- Added 2nd patch in series to fix a similar NULL dereference issue in\n  mdp5_mixer_release\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/485179/",
