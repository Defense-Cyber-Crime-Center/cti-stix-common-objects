An issue in versions 1.4.1 and below can let a release job reset the git root repository to the first commit. Version 1.5.0 has a patch for this issue. As a workaround, make sure the `PROJECT_PATH_RELEASE` (e.g. `releases/`) directory is manually and actually `git cloned` properly, making it a different git repostiory from the root git repository.",
