            "description": "In setAllowOnlyVpnForUids of NetworkManagementService.java, there is a possible security settings bypass due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege allowing users to access non-VPN networks, when they are supposed to be restricted to the VPN networks, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.",
