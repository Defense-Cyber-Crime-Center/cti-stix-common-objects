            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkeys: Fix overwrite of key expiration on instantiation\n\nThe expiry time of a key is unconditionally overwritten during\ninstantiation, defaulting to turn it permanent. This causes a problem\nfor DNS resolution as the expiration set by user-space is overwritten to\nTIME64_MAX, disabling further DNS updates. Fix this by restoring the\ncondition that key_set_expiry is only called when the pre-parser sets a\nspecific expiry.",
