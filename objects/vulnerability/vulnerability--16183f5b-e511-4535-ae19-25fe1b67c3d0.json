            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrtmutex: Drop rt_mutex::wait_lock before scheduling\n\nrt_mutex_handle_deadlock() is called with rt_mutex::wait_lock held.  In the\ngood case it returns with the lock held and in the deadlock case it emits a\nwarning and goes into an endless scheduling loop with the lock held, which\ntriggers the 'scheduling in atomic' warning.\n\nUnlock rt_mutex::wait_lock in the dead lock case before issuing the warning\nand dropping into the schedule for ever loop.\n\n[ tglx: Moved unlock before the WARN(), removed the pointless comment,\n  \tmassaged changelog, added Fixes tag ]",
