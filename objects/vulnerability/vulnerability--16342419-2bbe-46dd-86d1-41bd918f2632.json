            "description": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. FreeRDP based clients prior to version 3.5.1 are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read. This occurs when `WCHAR` string is read with twice the size it has and converted to `UTF-8`, `base64` decoded. The string is only used to compare against the redirection server certificate. Version 3.5.1 contains a patch for the issue. No known workarounds are available.",
