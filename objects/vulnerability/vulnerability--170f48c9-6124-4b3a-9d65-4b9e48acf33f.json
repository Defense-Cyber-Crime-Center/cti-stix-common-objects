The parameters used to enter data into the system do not have appropriate validation, which makes possible to smuggle in HTML/JavaScript code. This code will be executed in the user's browser space.This issue affects CemiPark software: 4.5, 4.7, 5.03 and potentially others. The vendor refused to provide the specific range of affected products.\n\n",
