            "description": "A vulnerability in the API of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read and delete arbitrary files on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need valid Super Admin credentials.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied parameters in API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted API request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or delete arbitrary files on the underlying operating system.",
