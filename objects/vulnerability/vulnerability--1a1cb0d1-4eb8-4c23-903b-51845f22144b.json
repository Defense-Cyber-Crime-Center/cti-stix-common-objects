Affected versions are subject to an Out-Of-Bounds Read in the `general_YUV444ToRGB_8u_P3AC4R_BGRX` function. This issue is likely down to insufficient data for the `pSrc` variable and results in crashes. This issue has been addressed in version 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
