            "description": "Cloudflare version of zlib library was found to be vulnerable to memory corruption issues affecting the deflation algorithm implementation (deflate.c). The issues resulted from improper input validation and heap-based buffer overflow.\nA local attacker could exploit the problem during compression using a crafted malicious file potentially leading to denial of service of the software.\nPatches: The issue has been patched in commit  8352d10 https://github.com/cloudflare/zlib/commit/8352d108c05db1bdc5ac3bdf834dad641694c13c . The upstream repository is not affected.\n",
