            "description": "ACE vulnerability in JaninoEventEvaluator  by QOS.CH logback-core\n      upto and including version 1.5.12 in Java applications allows\n      attacker to execute arbitrary code by compromising an existing\n      logback configuration file or by injecting an environment variable\n      before program execution.\n\n\n\n\n\nMalicious logback configuration files can allow the attacker to execute \narbitrary code using the JaninoEventEvaluator extension.\n\n\n\nA successful attack requires the user to have write access to a \nconfiguration file. Alternatively, the attacker could inject a malicious \nenvironment variable pointing to a malicious configuration file. In both \ncases, the attack requires existing privilege.",
