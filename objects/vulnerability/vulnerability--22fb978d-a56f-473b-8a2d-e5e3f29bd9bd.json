            "description": "The Image Hover Effects for Elementor with Lightbox and Flipbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the '_id', 'oxi_addons_f_title_tag', and 'content_description_tag' parameters in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
