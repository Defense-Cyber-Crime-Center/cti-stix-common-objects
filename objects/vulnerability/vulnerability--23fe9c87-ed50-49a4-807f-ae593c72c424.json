            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: nxp: imx8-isi: Check whether crossbar pad is non-NULL before access\n\nWhen translating source to sink streams in the crossbar subdev, the\ndriver tries to locate the remote subdev connected to the sink pad. The\nremote pad may be NULL, if userspace tries to enable a stream that ends\nat an unconnected crossbar sink. When that occurs, the driver\ndereferences the NULL pad, leading to a crash.\n\nPrevent the crash by checking if the pad is NULL before using it, and\nreturn an error if it is.",
