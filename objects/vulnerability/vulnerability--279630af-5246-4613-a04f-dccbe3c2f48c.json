            "description": "The Paid Membership Plugin, Ecommerce, User Registration Form, Login Form, User Profile & Restrict Content â€“ ProfilePress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'name' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 4.14.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This requires a member listing page to be active and using the Gerbera theme.",
