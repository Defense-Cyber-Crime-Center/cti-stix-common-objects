            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: errata: Add Cortex-A520 speculative unprivileged load workaround\n\nImplement the workaround for ARM Cortex-A520 erratum 2966298. On an\naffected Cortex-A520 core, a speculatively executed unprivileged load\nmight leak data from a privileged load via a cache side channel. The\nissue only exists for loads within a translation regime with the same\ntranslation (e.g. same ASID and VMID). Therefore, the issue only affects\nthe return to EL0.\n\nThe workaround is to execute a TLBI before returning to EL0 after all\nloads of privileged data. A non-shareable TLBI to any address is\nsufficient.\n\nThe workaround isn't necessary if page table isolation (KPTI) is\nenabled, but for simplicity it will be. Page table isolation should\nnormally be disabled for Cortex-A520 as it supports the CSV3 feature\nand the E0PD feature (used when KASLR is enabled).",
