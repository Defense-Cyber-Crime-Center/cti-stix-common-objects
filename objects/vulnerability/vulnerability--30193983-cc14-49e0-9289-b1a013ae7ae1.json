            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp: take care of mixed splice()/sendmsg(MSG_ZEROCOPY) case\n\nsyzbot found that mixing sendpage() and sendmsg(MSG_ZEROCOPY)\ncalls over the same TCP socket would again trigger the\ninfamous warning in inet_sock_destruct()\n\n\tWARN_ON(sk_forward_alloc_get(sk));\n\nWhile Talal took into account a mix of regular copied data\nand MSG_ZEROCOPY one in the same skb, the sendpage() path\nhas been forgotten.\n\nWe want the charging to happen for sendpage(), because\npages could be coming from a pipe. What is missing is the\ndowngrading of pure zerocopy status to make sure\nsk_forward_alloc will stay synced.\n\nAdd tcp_downgrade_zcopy_pure() helper so that we can\nuse it from the two callers.",
