            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvfio/pci: Disable auto-enable of exclusive INTx IRQ\n\nCurrently for devices requiring masking at the irqchip for INTx, ie.\ndevices without DisINTx support, the IRQ is enabled in request_irq()\nand subsequently disabled as necessary to align with the masked status\nflag.  This presents a window where the interrupt could fire between\nthese events, resulting in the IRQ incrementing the disable depth twice.\nThis would be unrecoverable for a user since the masked flag prevents\nnested enables through vfio.\n\nInstead, invert the logic using IRQF_NO_AUTOEN such that exclusive INTx\nis never auto-enabled, then unmask as required.",
