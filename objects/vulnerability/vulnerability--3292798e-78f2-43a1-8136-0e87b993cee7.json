            "description": "Acrobat Reader versions 24.002.21005, 24.001.30159, 20.005.30655, 24.003.20054 and earlier are affected by a Type Confusion vulnerability that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. This issue occurs when a resource is accessed using a type that is not compatible with the actual object type, leading to a logic error that an attacker could exploit. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.",
