            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: add missing check for inode numbers on directory entries\n\nSyzbot reported that mounting and unmounting a specific pattern of\ncorrupted nilfs2 filesystem images causes a use-after-free of metadata\nfile inodes, which triggers a kernel bug in lru_add_fn().\n\nAs Jan Kara pointed out, this is because the link count of a metadata file\ngets corrupted to 0, and nilfs_evict_inode(), which is called from iput(),\ntries to delete that inode (ifile inode in this case).\n\nThe inconsistency occurs because directories containing the inode numbers\nof these metadata files that should not be visible in the namespace are\nread without checking.\n\nFix this issue by treating the inode numbers of these internal files as\nerrors in the sanity check helper when reading directory folios/pages.\n\nAlso thanks to Hillf Danton and Matthew Wilcox for their initial mm-layer\nanalysis.",
