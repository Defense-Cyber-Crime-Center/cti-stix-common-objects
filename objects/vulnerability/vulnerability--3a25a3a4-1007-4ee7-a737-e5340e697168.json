            "description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in X.Org and Xwayland. When changing an alarm, the values of the change mask are evaluated one after the other, changing the trigger values as requested, and eventually, SyncInitTrigger() is called. If one of the changes triggers an error, the function will return early, not adding the new sync object, possibly causing a use-after-free when the alarm eventually triggers.",
