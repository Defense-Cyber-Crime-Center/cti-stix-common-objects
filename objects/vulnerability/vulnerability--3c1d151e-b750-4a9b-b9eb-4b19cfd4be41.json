            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKEYS: trusted: Fix TPM reservation for seal/unseal\n\nThe original patch 8c657a0590de (\"KEYS: trusted: Reserve TPM for seal\nand unseal operations\") was correct on the mailing list:\n\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20210128235621.127925-4-jarkko@kernel.org/\n\nBut somehow got rebased so that the tpm_try_get_ops() in\ntpm2_seal_trusted() got lost.  This causes an imbalanced put of the\nTPM ops and causes oopses on TIS based hardware.\n\nThis fix puts back the lost tpm_try_get_ops()",
