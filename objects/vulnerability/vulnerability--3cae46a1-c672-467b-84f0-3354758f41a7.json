            "description": "The NetCloud Exchange client for Windows, version 1.110.50, contains an insecure file and folder permissions vulnerability. A normal (non-admin) user could exploit the weakness in file and folder permissions to escalate privileges, execute arbitrary code and maintain persistence on the compromised machine. It has been identified that full control permissions exist on the ‘Everyone’ group (i.e. any user who has local access to the operating system regardless of their privileges).",
