            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nserial: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock\n\nWhen using the serial port as RS485 port, the tx statemachine is used to\ncontrol the RTS pin to drive the RS485 transceiver TX_EN pin. When the\nTTY port is closed in the middle of a transmission (for instance during\nuserland application crash), imx_uart_shutdown disables the interface\nand disables the Transmission Complete interrupt. afer that,\nimx_uart_stop_tx bails on an incomplete transmission, to be retriggered\nby the TC interrupt. This interrupt is disabled and therefore the tx\nstatemachine never transitions out of SEND. The statemachine is in\ndeadlock now, and the TX_EN remains low, making the interface useless.\n\nimx_uart_stop_tx now checks for incomplete transmission AND whether TC\ninterrupts are enabled before bailing to be retriggered. This makes sure\nthe state machine handling is reached, and is properly set to\nWAIT_AFTER_SEND.",
