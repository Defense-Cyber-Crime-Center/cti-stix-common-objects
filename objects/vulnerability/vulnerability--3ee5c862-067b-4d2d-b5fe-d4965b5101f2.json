            "description": "A CWE-122 “Heap-based Buffer Overflow” vulnerability in the “logger_generic” function of the “Ax_rtu” binary allows a remote authenticated attacker to trigger a memory corruption in the context of the binary. This may result in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition, possibly in the execution of arbitrary code with the same privileges of the process (root), or have other unspecified impacts on the device. This issue affects: AiLux imx6 bundle below version imx6_1.0.7-2.",
