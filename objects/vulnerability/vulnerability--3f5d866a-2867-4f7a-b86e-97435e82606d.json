            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmb: client: fix use-after-free of signing key\n\nCustomers have reported use-after-free in @ses->auth_key.response with\nSMB2.1 + sign mounts which occurs due to following race:\n\ntask A                         task B\ncifs_mount()\n dfs_mount_share()\n  get_session()\n   cifs_mount_get_session()    cifs_send_recv()\n    cifs_get_smb_ses()          compound_send_recv()\n     cifs_setup_session()        smb2_setup_request()\n      kfree_sensitive()           smb2_calc_signature()\n                                   crypto_shash_setkey() *UAF*\n\nFix this by ensuring that we have a valid @ses->auth_key.response by\nchecking whether @ses->ses_status is SES_GOOD or SES_EXITING with\n@ses->ses_lock held.  After commit 24a9799aa8ef (\"smb: client: fix UAF\nin smb2_reconnect_server()\"), we made sure to call ->logoff() only\nwhen @ses was known to be good (e.g. valid ->auth_key.response), so\nit's safe to access signing key when @ses->ses_status == SES_EXITING.",
