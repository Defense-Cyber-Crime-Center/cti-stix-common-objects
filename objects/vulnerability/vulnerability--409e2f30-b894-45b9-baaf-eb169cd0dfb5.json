            "description": "Sony XAV-AX5500 USB Configuration Descriptor Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows physically present attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Sony XAV-AX5500 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the USB host driver. A crafted USB configuration descriptor can trigger an overflow of a fixed-length buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device.\n\nWas ZDI-CAN-23185",
