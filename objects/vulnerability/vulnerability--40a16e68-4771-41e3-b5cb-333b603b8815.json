            "description": "If a specific sequence of actions is performed when opening a new tab, the triggering principal associated with the new tab may have been incorrect. The triggering principal is used to calculate many values, including the `Referer` and `Sec-*` headers, meaning there is the potential for incorrect security checks within the browser in addition to incorrect or misleading information sent to remote websites.\n*This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other versions of Firefox are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 127.",
