            "description": "Allegra getFileContentAsString Directory Traversal Information Disclosure Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Allegra. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the product implements a registration mechanism that can be used to create a new user with a sufficient privilege level.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the getFileContentAsString method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, leading to further compromise. Was ZDI-CAN-22530.",
