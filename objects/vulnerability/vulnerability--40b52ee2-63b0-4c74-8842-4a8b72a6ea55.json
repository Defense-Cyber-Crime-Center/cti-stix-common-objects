            "description": "The AffiEasy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.7. This is due to plugin improperly releasing the tagged and patched version of the plugin - the vulnerable version is used as the core files, while the patched version was included in a 'trunk' folder. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform a variety of actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
