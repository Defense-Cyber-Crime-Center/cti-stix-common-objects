Path Traversal is possible in `Oro\\Bundle\\GaufretteBundle\\FileManager::getTemporaryFileName`. With this method, an attacker can pass the path to a non-existent file, which will allow writing the content to a new file that will be available during script execution. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 5.0.9.",
