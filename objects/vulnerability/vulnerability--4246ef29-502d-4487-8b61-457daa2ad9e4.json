            "description": "The The GamiPress â€“ Gamification plugin to reward points, achievements, badges & ranks in WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via gamipress_do_shortcode() function in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.1. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.",
