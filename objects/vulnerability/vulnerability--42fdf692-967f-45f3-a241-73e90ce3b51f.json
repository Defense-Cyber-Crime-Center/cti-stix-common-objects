            "description": "In affected versions of Octopus Deploy where customers are using Active Directory for authentication it was possible for an unauthenticated user to make an API request against two endpoints which would retrieve some data from the associated Active Directory. The requests when crafted correctly would return specific information from user profiles (Email address/UPN and Display name) from one endpoint and group information ( Group ID and Display name) from the other. This vulnerability does not expose data within the Octopus Server product itself.",
