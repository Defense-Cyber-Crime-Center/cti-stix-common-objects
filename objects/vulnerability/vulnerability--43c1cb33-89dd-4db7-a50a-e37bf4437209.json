            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs: relax mount_setattr() permission checks\n\nWhen we added mount_setattr() I added additional checks compared to the\nlegacy do_reconfigure_mnt() and do_change_type() helpers used by regular\nmount(2). If that mount had a parent then verify that the caller and the\nmount namespace the mount is attached to match and if not make sure that\nit's an anonymous mount.\n\nThe real rootfs falls into neither category. It is neither an anoymous\nmount because it is obviously attached to the initial mount namespace\nbut it also obviously doesn't have a parent mount. So that means legacy\nmount(2) allows changing mount properties on the real rootfs but\nmount_setattr(2) blocks this. I never thought much about this but of\ncourse someone on this planet of earth changes properties on the real\nrootfs as can be seen in [1].\n\nSince util-linux finally switched to the new mount api in 2.39 not so\nlong ago it also relies on mount_setattr() and that surfaced this issue\nwhen Fedora 39 finally switched to it. Fix this.",
