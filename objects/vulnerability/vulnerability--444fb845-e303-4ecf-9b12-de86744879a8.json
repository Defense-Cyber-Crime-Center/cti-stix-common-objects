            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix hashtab overflow check on 32-bit arches\n\nThe hashtab code relies on roundup_pow_of_two() to compute the number of\nhash buckets, and contains an overflow check by checking if the\nresulting value is 0. However, on 32-bit arches, the roundup code itself\ncan overflow by doing a 32-bit left-shift of an unsigned long value,\nwhich is undefined behaviour, so it is not guaranteed to truncate\nneatly. This was triggered by syzbot on the DEVMAP_HASH type, which\ncontains the same check, copied from the hashtab code. So apply the same\nfix to hashtab, by moving the overflow check to before the roundup.",
