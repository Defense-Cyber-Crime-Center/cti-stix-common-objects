This issue left users unable to exit fullscreen mode using standard actions like pressing \"Esc\" or accessing right-click menus, resulting in a disrupted browsing experience until the browser is restarted.  \n*This bug only affects the application when running on macOS. Other operating systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 133, Firefox ESR < 128.5, Thunderbird < 133, and Thunderbird < 128.5.",
