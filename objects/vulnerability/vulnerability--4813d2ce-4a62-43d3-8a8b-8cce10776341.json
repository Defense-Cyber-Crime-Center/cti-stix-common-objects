            "description": "NocoDB is software for building databases as spreadsheets. Prior to 0.202.9, a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exists within the Formula virtual cell comments functionality. The nc-gui/components/virtual-cell/Formula.vue displays a v-html tag with the value of \"urls\" whose contents are processed by the function replaceUrlsWithLink(). This function recognizes the pattern URI::(XXX) and creates a hyperlink tag <a> with href=XXX. However, it leaves all the other contents outside of the pattern URI::(XXX) unchanged. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.202.9.\n",
