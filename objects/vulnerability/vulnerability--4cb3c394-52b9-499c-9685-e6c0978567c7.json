            "description": "\nA Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nIf an MX Series device receives PTP packets on an MPC3E that doesn't support PTP this causes a memory leak which will result in unpredictable behavior and ultimately in an MPC crash and restart.\n\nTo monitor for this issue, please use the following FPC vty level commands:\n\nshow heap\nshows an increase in \"LAN buffer\" utilization and\n\nshow clksync ptp nbr-upd-info\nshows non-zero \"Pending PFEs\" counter.\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC3E:\n\n\n\n  *  All versions earlier than 20.4R3-S3;\n  *  21.1 versions earlier than 21.1R3-S4;\n  *  21.2 versions earlier than 21.2R3;\n  *  21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R2-S1, 21.3R3;\n  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R2;\n  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
