In such a case we need to skip the wake\nevent as we came to this path from the timer interrupt and quite\nlikely system is already awake.\n\nWithout this fix we have got an Oops:\n\n    serial8250: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 0, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A\n    ...\n    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000010\n    RIP: 0010:serial8250_handle_irq+0x7c/0x240\n    Call Trace:\n     ? serial8250_handle_irq+0x7c/0x240\n     ? __pfx_serial8250_timeout+0x10/0x10",
