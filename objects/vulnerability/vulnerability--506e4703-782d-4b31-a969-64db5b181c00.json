            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: act_skbmod: Skip non-Ethernet packets\n\nCurrently tcf_skbmod_act() assumes that packets use Ethernet as their L2\nprotocol, which is not always the case.  As an example, for CAN devices:\n\n\t$ ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan\n\t$ ip link set up vcan0\n\t$ tc qdisc add dev vcan0 root handle 1: htb\n\t$ tc filter add dev vcan0 parent 1: protocol ip prio 10 \\\n\t\tmatchall action skbmod swap mac\n\nDoing the above silently corrupts all the packets.  Do not perform skbmod\nactions for non-Ethernet packets.",
