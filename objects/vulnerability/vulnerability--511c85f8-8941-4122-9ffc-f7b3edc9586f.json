            "description": "A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco&nbsp;Expressway Series and Cisco&nbsp;TelePresence VCS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the REST API to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected system to reload.\r\nCisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.&nbsp;",
