            "description": "ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the API endpoint `http://<Server-ip>/v1/users/name` allows unauthenticated users to access sensitive information, such as usernames, without any authorization. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to enumerate usernames and leverage them for further attacks, such as brute-force or phishing campaigns.
