            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: iwlwifi: fix double-free bug\n\nThe storage for the TLV PC register data wasn't done like all\nthe other storage in the drv->fw area, which is cleared at the\nend of deallocation. Therefore, the freeing must also be done\ndifferently, explicitly NULL'ing it out after the free, since\notherwise there's a nasty double-free bug here if a file fails\nto load after this has been parsed, and we get another free\nlater (e.g. because no other file exists.) Fix that by adding\nthe missing NULL assignment.",
