In versions 4.4.0 and 4.4.1, it is possible to get the Wazuh API administrator key used by the Dashboard using the browser development tools. This allows a logged user to the dashboard to become administrator of the API, even if their dashboard role is not. Version 4.4.2 contains a fix. There are no known workarounds.",
