            "description": "Wyze Cam v3 Wi-Fi SSID OS Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows physically present attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Wyze Cam v3 IP cameras. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of SSIDs embedded in scanned QR codes. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-22337.",
