            "description": "A vulnerability in the interaction between the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol preprocessor and the Snort 3 detection engine for Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the configured policies or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper error-checking when the Snort 3 detection engine is processing SMB traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SMB packet stream through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Snort process to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
