            "description": "The Conditional Fields for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.4.13. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpcf7cf_admin_init function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
