            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/MCE/AMD: Fix memory leak when threshold_create_bank() fails\n\nIn mce_threshold_create_device(), if threshold_create_bank() fails, the\npreviously allocated threshold banks array @bp will be leaked because\nthe call to mce_threshold_remove_device() will not free it.\n\nThis happens because mce_threshold_remove_device() fetches the pointer\nthrough the threshold_banks per-CPU variable but bp is written there\nonly after the bank creation is successful, and not before, when\nthreshold_create_bank() fails.\n\nAdd a helper which unwinds all the bank creation work previously done\nand pass into it the previously allocated threshold banks array for\nfreeing.\n\n  [ bp: Massage. ]",
