            "description": "A vulnerability in the command line interface (cli) management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage could allow an authenticated, local attacker to bypass authorization and allow the attacker to roll back the configuration on vManage controllers and edge router device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper access control in the cli-management interface of an affected system. An attacker with low-privilege (read only) access to the cli could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to roll back the configuration on for other controller and devices managed by an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to to roll back the configuration on for other controller and devices managed by an affected system.",
