            "description": "Internet passwords stored in Person documents in the Domino® Directory created using the \"Add Person\" action on the People & Groups tab in the Domino® Administrator are secured using a cryptographically weak hash algorithm.  This could enable attackers with access to the hashed value to determine a user's password, e.g. using a brute force attack.  This issue does not impact Person documents created through  user registration https://help.hcltechsw.com/domino/10.0.1/admin/conf_userregistration_c.html . \n",
