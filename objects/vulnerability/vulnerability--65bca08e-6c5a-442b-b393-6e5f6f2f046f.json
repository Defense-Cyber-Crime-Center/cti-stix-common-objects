            "description": "The Simple Redirection plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the settings_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings and redirect all site visitors via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
