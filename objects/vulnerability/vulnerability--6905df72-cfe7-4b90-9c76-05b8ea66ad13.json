            "description": "The The Back In Stock Notifier for WooCommerce | WooCommerce Waitlist Pro plugin for WordPress for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.1. This is due to the plugin for WordPress allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.",
