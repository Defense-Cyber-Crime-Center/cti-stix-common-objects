            "description": "parisneo/lollms-webui version 9.6 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Open Redirect due to inadequate input validation and processing of SVG files during the upload process. The XSS vulnerability allows attackers to embed malicious JavaScript code within SVG files, which is executed upon rendering, leading to potential credential theft and unauthorized data access. The Open Redirect vulnerability arises from insufficient URL validation within SVG files, enabling attackers to redirect users to malicious websites, thereby exposing them to phishing attacks, malware distribution, and reputation damage. These vulnerabilities are present in the application's functionality to send files to the AI module.",
