Due to the lack of protection mechanisms such as stack canaries and PIE, it is possible to successfully execute code even under restrictive conditions.\n\nThis issue affects \nZkTeco-based OEM devices (ZkTeco ProFace X, Smartec ST-FR043, Smartec ST-FR041ME and possibly others)\n\n with firmware \nZAM170-NF-1.8.25-7354-Ver1.0.0 and possibly others.",
