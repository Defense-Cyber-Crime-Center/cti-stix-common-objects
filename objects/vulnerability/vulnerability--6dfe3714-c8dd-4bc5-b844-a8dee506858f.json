            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AppDynamics Controller could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.",
