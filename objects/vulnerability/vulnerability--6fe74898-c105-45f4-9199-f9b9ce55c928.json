            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niwlwifi: fix use-after-free\n\nIf no firmware was present at all (or, presumably, all of the\nfirmware files failed to parse), we end up unbinding by calling\ndevice_release_driver(), which calls remove(), which then in\niwlwifi calls iwl_drv_stop(), freeing the 'drv' struct. However\nthe new code I added will still erroneously access it after it\nwas freed.\n\nSet 'failure=false' in this case to avoid the access, all data\nwas already freed anyway.",
