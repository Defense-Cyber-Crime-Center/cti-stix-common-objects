            "description": "A vulnerability in the Locator ID Separation Protocol (LISP) feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of LISP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LISP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r Note: This vulnerability could be exploited over either IPv4 or IPv6 transport.",
