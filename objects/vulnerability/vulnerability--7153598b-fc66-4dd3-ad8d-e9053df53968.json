            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nchar: xillybus: Check USB endpoints when probing device\n\nEnsure, as the driver probes the device, that all endpoints that the\ndriver may attempt to access exist and are of the correct type.\n\nAll XillyUSB devices must have a Bulk IN and Bulk OUT endpoint at\naddress 1. This is verified in xillyusb_setup_base_eps().\n\nOn top of that, a XillyUSB device may have additional Bulk OUT\nendpoints. The information about these endpoints' addresses is deduced\nfrom a data structure (the IDT) that the driver fetches from the device\nwhile probing it. These endpoints are checked in setup_channels().\n\nA XillyUSB device never has more than one IN endpoint, as all data\ntowards the host is multiplexed in this single Bulk IN endpoint. This is\nwhy setup_channels() only checks OUT endpoints.",
