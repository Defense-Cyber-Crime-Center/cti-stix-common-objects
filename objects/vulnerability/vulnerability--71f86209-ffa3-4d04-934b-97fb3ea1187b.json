This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from a log file, including system information and (in the Pro version) license keys. Successful exploitation requires an administrator to have used the 'Contact Us' functionality along with the \"Enable this option to automatically submit the log files.\" option.",
