            "description": "Module savepoints could be abused to inject references to malicious code delivered through the same domain. Attackers could perform malicious API requests or extract information from the users account. Exploiting this vulnerability requires temporary access to an account or successful social engineering to make a user follow a prepared link to a malicious account. Please deploy the provided updates and patch releases. The savepoint module path has been restricted to modules that provide the feature, excluding any arbitrary or non-existing modules. No publicly available exploits are known.",
