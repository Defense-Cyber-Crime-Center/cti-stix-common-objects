            "description": "The Post and Page Builder by BoldGrid â€“ Visual Drag and Drop Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.26.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping affecting the boldgrid_canvas_image AJAX endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.",
