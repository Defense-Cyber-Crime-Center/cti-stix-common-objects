            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: Fix loading 64-bit NOMMU kernels past the start of RAM\n\ncommit 3335068f8721 (\"riscv: Use PUD/P4D/PGD pages for the linear\nmapping\") added logic to allow using RAM below the kernel load address.\nHowever, this does not work for NOMMU, where PAGE_OFFSET is fixed to the\nkernel load address. Since that range of memory corresponds to PFNs\nbelow ARCH_PFN_OFFSET, mm initialization runs off the beginning of\nmem_map and corrupts adjacent kernel memory. Fix this by restoring the\nprevious behavior for NOMMU kernels.",
