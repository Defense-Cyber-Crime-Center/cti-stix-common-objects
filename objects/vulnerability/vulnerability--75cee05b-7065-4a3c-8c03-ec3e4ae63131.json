            "description": "The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.4.8. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'lwp_update_password_action' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user password via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
