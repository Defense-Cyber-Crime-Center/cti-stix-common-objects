            "description": "A flaw was found in KVM AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) in the Linux kernel. A KVM guest using SEV-ES or SEV-SNP with multiple vCPUs can trigger a double fetch race condition vulnerability and invoke the `VMGEXIT` handler recursively. If an attacker manages to call the handler multiple times, they can trigger a stack overflow and cause a denial of service or potentially guest-to-host escape in kernel configurations without stack guard pages (`CONFIG_VMAP_STACK`).",
