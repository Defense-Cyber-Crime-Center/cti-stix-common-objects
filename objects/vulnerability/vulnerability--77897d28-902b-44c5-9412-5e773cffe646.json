            "description": "The Campbell Scientific CSI Web Server stores web authentication credentials in a file with a specific file name. Passwords within that file are stored in a weakly encoded format. There is no known way to remotely access the file unless it has been manually renamed. However, if an attacker were to gain access to the file, passwords could be decoded and reused to gain access.",
