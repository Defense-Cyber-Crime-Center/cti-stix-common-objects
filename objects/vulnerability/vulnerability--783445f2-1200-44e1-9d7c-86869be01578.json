            "description": "The Auto Refresh Single Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.1 via deserialization of untrusted input from the arsp_options post meta option. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.",
