            "description": "The Woody code snippets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.3.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the runActions() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate and deactivate snippets via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
