            "description": "The FV Flowplayer Video Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘_fv_player_user_video’ parameter saved via the 'save' function hooked via init, and the plugin is also vulnerable to Arbitrary Usermeta Update via the 'save' function in versions up to, and including, 7.5.37.7212 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page, and makes it possible to update the user metas arbitrarily, but the meta value can only be a string.",
