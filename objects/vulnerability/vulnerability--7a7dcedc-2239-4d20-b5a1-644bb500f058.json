Prior to versions 1.13.13, 1.14.8, and 1.15.2, in Cilium clusters with IPsec enabled and traffic matching Layer 7 policies, IPsec-eligible traffic between a node's Envoy proxy and pods on other nodes is sent unencrypted and IPsec-eligible traffic between a node's DNS proxy and pods on other nodes is sent unencrypted. This issue has been resolved in Cilium 1.15.2, 1.14.8, and 1.13.13. There is no known workaround for this issue.",
