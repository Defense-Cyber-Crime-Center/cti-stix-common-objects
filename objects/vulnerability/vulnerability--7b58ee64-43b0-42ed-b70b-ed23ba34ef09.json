            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: rockchip: Resolve unbalanced runtime PM / system PM handling\n\nCommit e882575efc77 (\"spi: rockchip: Suspend and resume the bus during\nNOIRQ_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM ops\") stopped respecting runtime PM status and\nsimply disabled clocks unconditionally when suspending the system. This\ncauses problems when the device is already runtime suspended when we go\nto sleep -- in which case we double-disable clocks and produce a\nWARNing.\n\nSwitch back to pm_runtime_force_{suspend,resume}(), because that still\nseems like the right thing to do, and the aforementioned commit makes no\nexplanation why it stopped using it.\n\nAlso, refactor some of the resume() error handling, because it's not\nactually a good idea to re-disable clocks on failure.",
