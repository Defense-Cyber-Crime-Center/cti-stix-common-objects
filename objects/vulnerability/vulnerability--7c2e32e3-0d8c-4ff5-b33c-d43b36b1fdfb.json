            "description": "The The Grid Plus â€“ Unlimited grid layout plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via grid_plus_load_by_category AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.5. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.",
