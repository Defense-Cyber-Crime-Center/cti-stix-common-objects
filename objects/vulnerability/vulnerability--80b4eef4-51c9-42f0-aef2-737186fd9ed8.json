            "description": "The Funnelforms Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the fnsf_af2_save_post function in versions up to, and including, 3.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to modify certain post values. Note that the extent of modification is limited due to fixed values passed to the wp_update_post function.",
