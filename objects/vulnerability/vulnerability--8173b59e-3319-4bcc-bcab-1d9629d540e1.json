            "description": "Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take\na long time.\n\nImpact summary: Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check()\nto check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key that\nis being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead\nto a Denial of Service.\n\nWhen function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys,\na computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite.\nFor valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this\ncomputation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime,\nthen this computation would take a long time.\n\nAn application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA key\nobtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service\nattack.\n\nThe function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL\nfunctions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line\napplication. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used\nwith the '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.",
