            "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access sensitive information. This vulnerability is due to improper protections on file access through the CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a CLI command that targets an arbitrary file on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to return portions of an arbitrary file, possibly resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information.",
