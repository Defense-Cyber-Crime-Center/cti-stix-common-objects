            "description": "The Shariff Wrapper plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'shariff' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 4.6.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes like 'info_text'. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page and clicks the information icon.",
