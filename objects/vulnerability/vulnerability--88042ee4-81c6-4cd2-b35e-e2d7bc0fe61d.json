            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Implement bounds check for stream encoder creation in DCN401\n\n'stream_enc_regs' array is an array of dcn10_stream_enc_registers\nstructures. The array is initialized with four elements, corresponding\nto the four calls to stream_enc_regs() in the array initializer. This\nmeans that valid indices for this array are 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe error message 'stream_enc_regs' 4 <= 5 below, is indicating that\nthere is an attempt to access this array with an index of 5, which is\nout of bounds. This could lead to undefined behavior\n\nHere, eng_id is used as an index to access the stream_enc_regs array. If\neng_id is 5, this would result in an out-of-bounds access on the\nstream_enc_regs array.\n\nThus fixing Buffer overflow error in dcn401_stream_encoder_create\n\nFound by smatch:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/resource/dcn401/dcn401_resource.c:1209 dcn401_stream_encoder_create() error: buffer overflow 'stream_enc_regs' 4 <= 5",
