This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25.",
