            "description": "The Lightbox slider â€“ Responsive Lightbox Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.9 via deserialization of untrusted input through post meta data. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.",
