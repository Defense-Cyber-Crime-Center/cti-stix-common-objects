            "description": "The Shortcodes and extra features for Phlox theme plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's aux_timeline shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.15.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes such as thumb_mode and date_type. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
