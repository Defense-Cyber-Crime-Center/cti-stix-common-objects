            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: mma8452: Fix trigger reference couting\n\nThe mma8452 driver directly assigns a trigger to the struct iio_dev. The\nIIO core when done using this trigger will call `iio_trigger_put()` to drop\nthe reference count by 1.\n\nWithout the matching `iio_trigger_get()` in the driver the reference count\ncan reach 0 too early, the trigger gets freed while still in use and a\nuse-after-free occurs.\n\nFix this by getting a reference to the trigger before assigning it to the\nIIO device.",
