            "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Intersight Virtual Appliance could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to access internal HTTP services that are otherwise inaccessible.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions on internally accessible http proxies. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker access to internal subnets beyond the sphere of their intended access level.",
