            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfc: nci: Fix uninit-value in nci_dev_up and nci_ntf_packet\n\nsyzbot reported the following uninit-value access issue [1][2]:\n\nnci_rx_work() parses and processes received packet. When the payload\nlength is zero, each message type handler reads uninitialized payload\nand KMSAN detects this issue. The receipt of a packet with a zero-size\npayload is considered unexpected, and therefore, such packets should be\nsilently discarded.\n\nThis patch resolved this issue by checking payload size before calling\neach message type handler codes.",
