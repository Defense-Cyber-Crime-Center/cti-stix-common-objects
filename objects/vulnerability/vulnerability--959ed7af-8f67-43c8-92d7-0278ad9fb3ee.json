            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: ieee802154: at86rf230: Stop leaking skb's\n\nUpon error the ieee802154_xmit_complete() helper is not called. Only\nieee802154_wake_queue() is called manually. In the Tx case we then leak\nthe skb structure.\n\nFree the skb structure upon error before returning when appropriate.\n\nAs the 'is_tx = 0' cannot be moved in the complete handler because of a\npossible race between the delay in switching to STATE_RX_AACK_ON and a\nnew interrupt, we introduce an intermediate 'was_tx' boolean just for\nthis purpose.\n\nThere is no Fixes tag applying here, many changes have been made on this\narea and the issue kind of always existed.",
