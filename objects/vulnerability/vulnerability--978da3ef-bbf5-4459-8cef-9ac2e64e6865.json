Versions 2.2 and earlier for release builds and versions 425 and earlier for nightly builds suffer from use of a weak cryptographic algorithm (RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding). The issue will be patched in v2.3 for release builds and 426 onwards for nightly builds. As a workaround, one may disable an advance security feature if not required.",
