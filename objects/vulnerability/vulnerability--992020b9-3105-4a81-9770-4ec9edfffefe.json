            "description": "A vulnerability in the login authentication functionality of the Remote Access SSL VPN feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to deny further VPN user authentications for several minutes, resulting in a temporary denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to ineffective handling of memory resources during the authentication process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets, which could cause resource exhaustion of the authentication process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to deny authentication for Remote Access SSL VPN users for several minutes, resulting in a temporary DoS condition.",
