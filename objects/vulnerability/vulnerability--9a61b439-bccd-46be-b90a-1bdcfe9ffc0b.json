            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5e: Skip restore TC rules for vport rep without loaded flag\n\nDuring driver unload, unregister_netdev is called after unloading\nvport rep. So, the mlx5e_rep_priv is already freed while trying to get\nrpriv->netdev, or walk rpriv->tc_ht, which results in use-after-free.\nSo add the checking to make sure access the data of vport rep which is\nstill loaded.",
