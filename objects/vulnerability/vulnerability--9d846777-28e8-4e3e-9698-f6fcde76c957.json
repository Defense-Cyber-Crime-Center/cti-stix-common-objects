            "description": "The MultiVendorX â€“ The Ultimate WooCommerce Multivendor Marketplace Solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions in api/class-mvx-rest-controller.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update vendor account details, create vendor accounts, and delete arbitrary users via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
