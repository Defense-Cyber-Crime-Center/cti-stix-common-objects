            "description": "A deep link validation issue in KakaoTalk 10.4.3 allowed a remote adversary to direct users to run any attacker-controller JavaScript within a WebView. The impact was further escalated by triggering another WebView that leaked its access token in a HTTP request header. Ultimately, this access token could be used to takeover another user's account and read her/his chat messages.",
