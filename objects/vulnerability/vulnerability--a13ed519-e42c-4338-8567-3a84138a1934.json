            "description": "A vulnerability in the cluster backup feature of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software, formerly Firepower Management Center Software, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user data that is supplied through the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid credentials for a user account with at least the role of Network Administrator. In addition, the attacker would need to persuade a legitimate user to initiate a cluster backup on the affected device.",
