A file disclosure vulnerability exists in the GetFileContents SOAP action exposed via /landesk/managementsuite/core/core.secure/OsdScript.asmx. The application does not sufficiently restrict user-supplied paths, allowing for an authenticated attacker to read arbitrary files from a remote system, including the private key used to authenticate to agents for remote access.",
