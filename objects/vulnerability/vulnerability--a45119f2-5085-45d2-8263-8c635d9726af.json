Prior to version 1.2.0, a cross-site scripting vulnerability has the potential to steal a user's cookie and gain unauthorized access to that user's account through the stolen cookie or redirect users to other malicious sites. Users should upgrade to version 1.2.0 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, apply the patch manually.",
