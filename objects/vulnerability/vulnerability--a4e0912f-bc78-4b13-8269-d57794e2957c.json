            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: khugepaged: skip huge page collapse for special files\n\nThe read-only THP for filesystems will collapse THP for files opened\nreadonly and mapped with VM_EXEC.  The intended usecase is to avoid TLB\nmisses for large text segments.  But it doesn't restrict the file types\nso a THP could be collapsed for a non-regular file, for example, block\ndevice, if it is opened readonly and mapped with EXEC permission.  This\nmay cause bugs, like [1] and [2].\n\nThis is definitely not the intended usecase, so just collapse THP for\nregular files in order to close the attack surface.\n\n[shy828301@gmail.com: fix vm_file check [3]]",
