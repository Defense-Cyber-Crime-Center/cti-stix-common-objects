            "description": "An Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nWhen a high amount of specific traffic is received on a SRX4600 device, due to an error in internal packet handling, a consistent rise in CPU memory utilization occurs. This results in packet drops in the traffic and eventually the PFE crashes. A manual reboot of the PFE will be required to restore the device to original state.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS:  \n21.2 before 21.2R3-S7,\n21.4 before 21.4R3-S6, \n22.1 before 22.1R3-S5, \n22.2 before 22.2R3-S3,\n22.3 before 22.3R3-S2,\n22.4 before 22.4R3,\n23.2 before 23.2R1-S2, 23.2R2.\n\n\n",
