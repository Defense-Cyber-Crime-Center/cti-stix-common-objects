            "description": "SAP Transportation Management (Collaboration\nPortal) allows an attacker with non-administrative privileges to send a crafted\nrequest from a vulnerable web application. This will trigger the application\nhandler to send a request to an unintended service, which may reveal\ninformation about that service. The information obtained could be used to\ntarget internal systems behind firewalls that are normally inaccessible to an\nattacker from the external network, resulting in a Server-Side Request Forgery\nvulnerability. There is no effect on integrity or availability of the\napplication.",
