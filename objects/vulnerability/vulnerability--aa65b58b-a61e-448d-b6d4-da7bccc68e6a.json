            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: hda: cs35l56: Fix lifetime of cs_dsp instance\n\nThe cs_dsp instance is initialized in the driver probe() so it\nshould be freed in the driver remove(). Also fix a missing call\nto cs_dsp_remove() in the error path of cs35l56_hda_common_probe().\n\nThe call to cs_dsp_remove() was being done in the component unbind\ncallback cs35l56_hda_unbind(). This meant that if the driver was\nunbound and then re-bound it would be using an uninitialized cs_dsp\ninstance.\n\nIt is best to initialize the cs_dsp instance in probe() so that it\ncan return an error if it fails. The component binding API doesn't\nhave any error handling so there's no way to handle a failure if\ncs_dsp was initialized in the bind.",
