            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/edid: In connector_bad_edid() cap num_of_ext by num_blocks read\n\nIn commit e11f5bd8228f (\"drm: Add support for DP 1.4 Compliance edid\ncorruption test\") the function connector_bad_edid() started assuming\nthat the memory for the EDID passed to it was big enough to hold\n`edid[0x7e] + 1` blocks of data (1 extra for the base block). It\ncompletely ignored the fact that the function was passed `num_blocks`\nwhich indicated how much memory had been allocated for the EDID.\n\nLet's fix this by adding a bounds check.\n\nThis is important for handling the case where there's an error in the\nfirst block of the EDID. In that case we will call\nconnector_bad_edid() without having re-allocated memory based on\n`edid[0x7e]`.",
