This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create a denial-of-service condition on affected installations of Unified Automation UaGateway. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the ImportXML function. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-20497.",
