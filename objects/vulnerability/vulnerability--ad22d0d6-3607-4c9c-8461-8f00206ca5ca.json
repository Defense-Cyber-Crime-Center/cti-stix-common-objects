            "description": "A vulnerability in Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) processing of Cisco Secure Client Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) of Cisco Secure Client.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to an integer underflow condition. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IKEv2 packet to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause Cisco Secure Client Software to crash, resulting in a DoS condition on the client software.\r\n\r Note: Cisco Secure Client Software releases 4.10 and earlier were known as Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.",
