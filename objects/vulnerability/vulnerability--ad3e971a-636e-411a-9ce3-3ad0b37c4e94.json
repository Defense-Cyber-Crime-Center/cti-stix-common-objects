            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmptcp: fix data stream corruption\n\nMaxim reported several issues when forcing a TCP transparent proxy\nto use the MPTCP protocol for the inbound connections. He also\nprovided a clean reproducer.\n\nThe problem boils down to 'mptcp_frag_can_collapse_to()' assuming\nthat only MPTCP will use the given page_frag.\n\nIf others - e.g. the plain TCP protocol - allocate page fragments,\nwe can end-up re-using already allocated memory for mptcp_data_frag.\n\nFix the issue ensuring that the to-be-expanded data fragment is\nlocated at the current page frag end.\n\nv1 -> v2:\n - added missing fixes tag (Mat)",
