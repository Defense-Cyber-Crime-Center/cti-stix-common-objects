            "description": "Adobe Commerce versions 2.4.7-beta1, 2.4.7-p3, 2.4.6-p8, 2.4.5-p10, 2.4.4-p11 and earlier are affected by a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability that could result in a security feature bypass. An attacker could exploit this race condition to alter a condition after it has been checked but before it is used, potentially bypassing security mechanisms. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction.",
