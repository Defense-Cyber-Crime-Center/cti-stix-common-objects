            "description": "An arbitrary file creation vulnerability exists in the Javascript exportDataObject API of Foxit Reader 12.1.3.15356 due to a failure to properly validate a dangerous extension. A specially crafted malicious file can create files at arbitrary locations, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. Exploitation is also possible if a user visits a specially-crafted malicious site if the browser plugin extension is enabled.",
