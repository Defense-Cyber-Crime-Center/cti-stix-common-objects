            "description": "The Reset plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the reset_db_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset several tables in the database like comments, themes, plugins, and more via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
