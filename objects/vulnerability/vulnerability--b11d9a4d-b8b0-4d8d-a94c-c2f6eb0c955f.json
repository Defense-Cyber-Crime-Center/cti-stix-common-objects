            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nphy: lynx-28g: serialize concurrent phy_set_mode_ext() calls to shared registers\n\nThe protocol converter configuration registers PCC8, PCCC, PCCD\n(implemented by the driver), as well as others, control protocol\nconverters from multiple lanes (each represented as a different\nstruct phy). So, if there are simultaneous calls to phy_set_mode_ext()\nto lanes sharing the same PCC register (either for the \"old\" or for the\n\"new\" protocol), corruption of the values programmed to hardware is\npossible, because lynx_28g_rmw() has no locking.\n\nAdd a spinlock in the struct lynx_28g_priv shared by all lanes, and take\nthe global spinlock from the phy_ops :: set_mode() implementation. There\nare no other callers which modify PCC registers.",
