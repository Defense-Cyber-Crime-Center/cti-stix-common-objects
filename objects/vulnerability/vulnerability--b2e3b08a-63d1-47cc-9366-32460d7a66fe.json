Versions 8.5.6 and prior are vulnerable to heap buffer read overflow in `FileManager::detectLanguageFromTextBegining `. The exploitability of this issue is not clear. Potentially, it may be used to leak internal memory allocation information. As of time of publication, no known patches are available in existing versions of Notepad++.",
