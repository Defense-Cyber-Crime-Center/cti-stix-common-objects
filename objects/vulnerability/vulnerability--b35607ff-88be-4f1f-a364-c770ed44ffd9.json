            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: mpt3sas: Avoid test/set_bit() operating in non-allocated memory\n\nThere is a potential out-of-bounds access when using test_bit() on a single\nword. The test_bit() and set_bit() functions operate on long values, and\nwhen testing or setting a single word, they can exceed the word\nboundary. KASAN detects this issue and produces a dump:\n\n\t BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in _scsih_add_device.constprop.0 (./arch/x86/include/asm/bitops.h:60 ./include/asm-generic/bitops/instrumented-atomic.h:29 drivers/scsi/mpt3sas/mpt3sas_scsih.c:7331) mpt3sas\n\n\t Write of size 8 at addr ffff8881d26e3c60 by task kworker/u1536:2/2965\n\nFor full log, please look at [1].\n\nMake the allocation at least the size of sizeof(unsigned long) so that\nset_bit() and test_bit() have sufficient room for read/write operations\nwithout overwriting unallocated memory.\n\n[1] Link: https://lore.kernel.org/all/ZkNcALr3W3KGYYJG@gmail.com/",
