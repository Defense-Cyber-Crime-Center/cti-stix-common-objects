            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nInput: adp5589-keys - fix NULL pointer dereference\n\nWe register a devm action to call adp5589_clear_config() and then pass\nthe i2c client as argument so that we can call i2c_get_clientdata() in\norder to get our device object. However, i2c_set_clientdata() is only\nbeing set at the end of the probe function which means that we'll get a\nNULL pointer dereference in case the probe function fails early.",
