            "description": "SAS application is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Improper input validation in the `_program` parameter of the the `/SASStoredProcess/do` endpoint allows arbitrary JavaScript to be executed when specially crafted URL is opened by an authenticated user. The attack is possible from a low-privileged user. Only versions 9.4_M7 and 9.4_M8 were tested and confirmed to be vulnerable, status of others is unknown. For above mentioned versions hot fixes were published. \n",
