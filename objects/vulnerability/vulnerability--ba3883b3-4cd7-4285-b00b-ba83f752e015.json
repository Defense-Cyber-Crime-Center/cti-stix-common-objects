            "description": "A flaw was found in grub2. When reading a symbolic link's name from a UFS filesystem, grub2 fails to validate the string length taken as an input. The lack of validation may lead to a heap out-of-bounds write, causing data integrity issues and eventually allowing an attacker to circumvent secure boot protections.",
