            "description": "The NASAâ€™s Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) is an implementation of Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN). A segmentation fault occurs with ION-DTN BPv7 software version 4.1.3 when a bundle with a Destination Endpoint ID (EID) set to dtn:none is received. This causes the node to become unresponsive to incoming bundles, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.3s.",
