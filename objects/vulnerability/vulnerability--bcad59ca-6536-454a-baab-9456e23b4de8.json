            "description": "The WooCommerce Checkout & Funnel Builder by CartFlows – Create High Converting Stores For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘custom_upload_mimes’ function in versions up to, and including, 2.0.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
