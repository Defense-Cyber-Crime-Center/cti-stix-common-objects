            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntty: n_gsm: fix possible out-of-bounds in gsm0_receive()\n\nAssuming the following:\n- side A configures the n_gsm in basic option mode\n- side B sends the header of a basic option mode frame with data length 1\n- side A switches to advanced option mode\n- side B sends 2 data bytes which exceeds gsm->len\n  Reason: gsm->len is not used in advanced option mode.\n- side A switches to basic option mode\n- side B keeps sending until gsm0_receive() writes past gsm->buf\n  Reason: Neither gsm->state nor gsm->len have been reset after\n  reconfiguration.\n\nFix this by changing gsm->count to gsm->len comparison from equal to less\nthan. Also add upper limit checks against the constant MAX_MRU in\ngsm0_receive() and gsm1_receive() to harden against memory corruption of\ngsm->len and gsm->mru.\n\nAll other checks remain as we still need to limit the data according to the\nuser configuration and actual payload size.",
