            "description": "BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom designed to help teachers teach and learners learn. An attacker may be able to exploit the overly elevated file permissions in the `/usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.7.0/gems/resque-2.6.0` directory with the goal of privilege escalation, potentially exposing sensitive information on the server. This issue has been patched in version(s) 2.6.18, 2.7.8 and 3.0.0-alpha.7.\n",
