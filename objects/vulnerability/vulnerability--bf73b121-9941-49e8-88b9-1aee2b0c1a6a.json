            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsysctl: Fix data races in proc_douintvec().\n\nA sysctl variable is accessed concurrently, and there is always a chance\nof data-race.  So, all readers and writers need some basic protection to\navoid load/store-tearing.\n\nThis patch changes proc_douintvec() to use READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE()\ninternally to fix data-races on the sysctl side.  For now, proc_douintvec()\nitself is tolerant to a data-race, but we still need to add annotations on\nthe other subsystem's side.",
