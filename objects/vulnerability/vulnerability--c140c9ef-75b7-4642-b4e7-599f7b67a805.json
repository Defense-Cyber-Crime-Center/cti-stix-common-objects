            "description": "The ProfileGrid â€“ User Profiles, Groups and Communities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 5.9.3.2 due to incorrect use of the wp_kses_allowed_html function, which allows the 'onclick' attribute for certain HTML elements without sufficient restriction or context validation. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
