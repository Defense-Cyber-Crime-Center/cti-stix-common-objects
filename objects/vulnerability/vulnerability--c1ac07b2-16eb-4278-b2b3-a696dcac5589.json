            "description": "If Brocade Fabric OS before Fabric OS 9.2.0 configuration settings are not set to encrypt SNMP passwords, then the SNMP privsecret / authsecret fields can be exposed in plaintext. The plaintext passwords can be exposed in a configupload capture or a supportsave capture if encryption of passwords is not enabled. An attacker can use these passwords to fetch values of the supported OIDs via SNMPv3 queries. There are also a limited number of MIB objects that can be modified.",
