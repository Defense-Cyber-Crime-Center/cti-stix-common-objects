            "description": "The Node.js Permission Model does not clarify in the documentation that wildcards should be only used as the last character of a file path. For example:\n```\n --allow-fs-read=/home/node/.ssh/*.pub\n```\n\nwill ignore `pub` and give access to everything after `.ssh/`.\n\nThis misleading documentation affects all users using the experimental permission model in Node.js 20 and Node.js 21.\n\nPlease note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.",
