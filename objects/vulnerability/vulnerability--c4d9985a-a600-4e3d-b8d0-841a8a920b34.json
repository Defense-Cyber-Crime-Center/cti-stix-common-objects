            "description": "In dotCMS, versions mentioned, a flaw in the NormalizationFilter does not strip double slashes (//) from URLs, potentially enabling bypasses for XSS and access controls. An example affected URL is  https://demo.dotcms.com//html/portlet/ext/files/edit_text_inc.jsp https://demo.dotcms.com//html/portlet/ext/files/edit_text_inc.jsp , which should return a 404 response but didn't. \n\nThe oversight in the default invalid URL character list can be viewed at the provided  GitHub link https://github.com/dotCMS/core/blob/master/dotCMS/src/main/java/com/dotcms/filters/NormalizationFilter.java#L37 .Â \n\nTo mitigate, users can block URLs with double slashes at firewalls or utilize dotCMS config variables.\n\nSpecifically, they can use the DOT_URI_NORMALIZATION_FORBIDDEN_STRINGS environmental variable to add // to the list of invalid strings. \n\nAdditionally, the DOT_URI_NORMALIZATION_FORBIDDEN_REGEX variable offers more detailed control, for instance, to block //html.* URLs.\n\nFix Version:23.06+, LTS 22.03.7+, LTS 23.01.4+\n",
