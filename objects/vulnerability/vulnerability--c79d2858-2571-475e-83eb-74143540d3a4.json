If exploited, this could\ncause account takeover and unauthorized access to the system\nwhen an attacker conducts brute-force attacks against the\nequipment login. Note that the system supports only one concurrent session and implements a delay of more than a second\nbetween failed login attempts making it difficult to automate the\nattacks.",
