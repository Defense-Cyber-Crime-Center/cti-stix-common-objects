            "description": "The Minimal Coming Soon â€“ Coming Soon Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the validate_ajax, deactivate_ajax, and save_ajax functions in all versions up to, and including, 2.38. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to edit the license key, which could disable features of the plugin.",
