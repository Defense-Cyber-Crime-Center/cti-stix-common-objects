            "description": "Rubygems.org is the Ruby community's gem hosting service. Rubygems.org users with MFA enabled would normally be protected from account takeover in the case of email account takeover. However, a workaround on the forgotten password form allows an attacker to bypass the MFA requirement and takeover the account. This vulnerability has been patched in commit 0b3272a.",
