            "description": "The Website Builder by SeedProd â€” Theme Builder, Landing Page Builder, Coming Soon Page, Maintenance Mode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the seedprod_lite_new_lpage function in all versions up to, and including, 6.15.21. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the contents of coming-soon, maintenance pages, login and 404 pages set up with the plugin. Version 6.15.22 addresses this issue but introduces a bug affecting admin pages. We suggest upgrading to 6.15.23.",
