            "description": "A vulnerability in the CDP processing feature of Cisco ISE could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition of the CDP process on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checking when an affected device processes CDP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted CDP traffic to the device. A successful exploit could cause the CDP process to crash, impacting neighbor discovery and the ability of Cisco ISE to determine the reachability of remote devices. After a crash, the CDP process must be manually restarted using the cdp enable command in interface configuration mode.",
