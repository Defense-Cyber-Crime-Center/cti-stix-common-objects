            "description": "SAP NetWeaver Enterprise Portal versions - 7.10, 7.11, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50, does not sufficiently encode user related data, resulting in Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This would allow an attacker with administrative privileges to store a malicious script on the portal. The execution of the script content by a victim registered on the portal could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of portal content.",
