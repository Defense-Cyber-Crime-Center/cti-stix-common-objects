A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to the execution of arbitrary OS commands and possible system takeover. This is a critical vulnerability as it allows an attacker to cause severe damage. Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.\n\n",
