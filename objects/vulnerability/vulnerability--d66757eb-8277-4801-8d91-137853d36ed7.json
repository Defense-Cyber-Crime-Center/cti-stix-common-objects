            "description": "NETGEAR R7800 net-cgi Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR R7800 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of the soap_block_table file. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.\n. Was ZDI-CAN-13055.",
