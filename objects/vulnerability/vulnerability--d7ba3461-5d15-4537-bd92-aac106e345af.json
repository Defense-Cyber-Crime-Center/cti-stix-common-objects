            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncachefiles: flush all requests after setting CACHEFILES_DEAD\n\nIn ondemand mode, when the daemon is processing an open request, if the\nkernel flags the cache as CACHEFILES_DEAD, the cachefiles_daemon_write()\nwill always return -EIO, so the daemon can't pass the copen to the kernel.\nThen the kernel process that is waiting for the copen triggers a hung_task.\n\nSince the DEAD state is irreversible, it can only be exited by closing\n/dev/cachefiles. Therefore, after calling cachefiles_io_error() to mark\nthe cache as CACHEFILES_DEAD, if in ondemand mode, flush all requests to\navoid the above hungtask. We may still be able to read some of the cached\ndata before closing the fd of /dev/cachefiles.\n\nNote that this relies on the patch that adds reference counting to the req,\notherwise it may UAF.",
