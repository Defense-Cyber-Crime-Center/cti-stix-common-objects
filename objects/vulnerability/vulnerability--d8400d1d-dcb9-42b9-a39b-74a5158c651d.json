            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/dpu: Add mutex lock in control vblank irq\n\nAdd a mutex lock to control vblank irq to synchronize vblank\nenable/disable operations happening from different threads to prevent\nrace conditions while registering/unregistering the vblank irq callback.\n\nv4: -Removed vblank_ctl_lock from dpu_encoder_virt, so it is only a\n    parameter of dpu_encoder_phys.\n    -Switch from atomic refcnt to a simple int counter as mutex has\n    now been added\nv3: Mistakenly did not change wording in last version. It is done now.\nv2: Slightly changed wording of commit message\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/571854/",
