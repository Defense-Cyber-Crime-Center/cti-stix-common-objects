            "description": "An Improper Physical Access Control vulnerability in the console port control of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker with physical access to the device to get access to a user account.\n\nWhen the console cable is disconnected, the logged in user is not logged out. This allows a malicious attacker with physical access to the console to resume a previous session and possibly gain administrative privileges.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS Evolved: \n  *  from 23.2R2-EVO before 23.2R2-S1-EVO, \n  *  from 23.4R1-EVO before 23.4R2-EVO.",
