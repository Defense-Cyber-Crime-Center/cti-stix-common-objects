            "description": "This vulnerability exists in SyroTech SY-GPON-1110-WDONT Router due to storing of FTP credentials in plaintext within the SquashFS-root filesystem associated with the router's firmware. An attacker with physical access could exploit this by extracting the firmware and reverse engineer the binary data to access the plaintext FTP credentials from the vulnerable system.\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the FTP server associated with the targeted system.",
