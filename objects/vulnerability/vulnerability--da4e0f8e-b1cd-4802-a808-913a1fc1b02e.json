            "description": "Cross-site Resource Forgery (CSRF), Privilege escalation vulnerability in Apache Roller. On multi-blog/user Roller websites, by default weblog owners are trusted to publish arbitrary weblog content and this combined with a deficiency in Roller's CSRF protections allowed an escalation of privileges attack. This issue affects Apache Roller before 6.1.4.\n\nRoller users who run multi-blog/user Roller websites are recommended to upgrade to version 6.1.4, which fixes the issue.\n\nRoller 6.1.4 release announcement:Â  https://lists.apache.org/thread/3c3f6rwqptyw6wdc95654fq5vlosqdpw",
