            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Add NULL check for function pointer in dcn32_set_output_transfer_func\n\nThis commit adds a null check for the set_output_gamma function pointer\nin the dcn32_set_output_transfer_func function. Previously,\nset_output_gamma was being checked for null, but then it was being\ndereferenced without any null check. This could lead to a null pointer\ndereference if set_output_gamma is null.\n\nTo fix this, we now ensure that set_output_gamma is not null before\ndereferencing it. We do this by adding a null check for set_output_gamma\nbefore the call to set_output_gamma.",
