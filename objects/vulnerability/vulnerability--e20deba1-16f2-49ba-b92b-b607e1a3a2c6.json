            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npower: supply: core: Fix boundary conditions in interpolation\n\nThe functions power_supply_temp2resist_simple and power_supply_ocv2cap_simple\nhandle boundary conditions incorrectly.\nThe change was introduced in a4585ba2050f460f749bbaf2b67bd56c41e30283\n(\"power: supply: core: Use library interpolation\").\nThere are two issues: First, the lines \"high = i - 1\" and \"high = i\" in ocv2cap\nhave the wrong order compared to temp2resist. As a consequence, ocv2cap\nsets high=-1 if ocv>table[0].ocv, which causes an out-of-bounds read.\nSecond, the logic of temp2resist is also not correct.\nConsider the case table[] = {{20, 100}, {10, 80}, {0, 60}}.\nFor temp=5, we expect a resistance of 70% by interpolation.\nHowever, temp2resist sets high=low=2 and returns 60.",
