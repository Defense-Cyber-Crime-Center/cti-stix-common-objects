            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: usb: aqc111: Fix out-of-bounds accesses in RX fixup\n\naqc111_rx_fixup() contains several out-of-bounds accesses that can be\ntriggered by a malicious (or defective) USB device, in particular:\n\n - The metadata array (desc_offset..desc_offset+2*pkt_count) can be out of bounds,\n   causing OOB reads and (on big-endian systems) OOB endianness flips.\n - A packet can overlap the metadata array, causing a later OOB\n   endianness flip to corrupt data used by a cloned SKB that has already\n   been handed off into the network stack.\n - A packet SKB can be constructed whose tail is far beyond its end,\n   causing out-of-bounds heap data to be considered part of the SKB's\n   data.\n\nFound doing variant analysis. Tested it with another driver (ax88179_178a), since\nI don't have a aqc111 device to test it, but the code looks very similar.",
