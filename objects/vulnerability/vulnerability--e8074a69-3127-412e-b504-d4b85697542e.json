            "description": "The WP Recipe Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the use of the 'tag' attribute in the wprm-recipe-name, wprm-recipe-date, and wprm-recipe-counter shortcodes in all versions up to, and including, 9.1.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
