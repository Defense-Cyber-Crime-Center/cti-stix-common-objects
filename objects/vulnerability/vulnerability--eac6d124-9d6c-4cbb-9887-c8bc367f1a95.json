            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: x86: Use __try_cmpxchg_user() to update guest PTE A/D bits\n\nUse the recently introduced __try_cmpxchg_user() to update guest PTE A/D\nbits instead of mapping the PTE into kernel address space.  The VM_PFNMAP\npath is broken as it assumes that vm_pgoff is the base pfn of the mapped\nVMA range, which is conceptually wrong as vm_pgoff is the offset relative\nto the file and has nothing to do with the pfn.  The horrific hack worked\nfor the original use case (backing guest memory with /dev/mem), but leads\nto accessing \"random\" pfns for pretty much any other VM_PFNMAP case.",
