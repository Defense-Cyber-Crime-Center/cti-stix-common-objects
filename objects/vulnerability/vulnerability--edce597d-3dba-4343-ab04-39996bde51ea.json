            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntools/power turbostat: Fix offset overflow issue in index converting\n\nThe idx_to_offset() function returns type int (32-bit signed), but\nMSR_PKG_ENERGY_STAT is u32 and would be interpreted as a negative number.\nThe end result is that it hits the if (offset < 0) check in update_msr_sum()\nwhich prevents the timer callback from updating the stat in the background when\nlong durations are used. The similar issue exists in offset_to_idx() and\nupdate_msr_sum(). Fix this issue by converting the 'int' to 'off_t' accordingly.",
