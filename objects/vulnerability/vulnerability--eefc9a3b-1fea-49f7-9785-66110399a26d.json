This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the configuration_page function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add and import redirects, including comments containing cross-site scripting as detailed in CVE-2023-1602, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
