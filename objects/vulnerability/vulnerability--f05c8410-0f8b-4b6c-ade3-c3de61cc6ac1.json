            "description": "SiYuan is a personal knowledge management system. Prior to version 3.1.16, SiYuan's /api/export/exportResources endpoint is vulnerable to arbitary file read via path traversal. It is possible to manipulate the paths parameter to access and download arbitrary files from the host system by traversing the workspace directory structure. Version 3.1.16 contains a patch for the issue.",
