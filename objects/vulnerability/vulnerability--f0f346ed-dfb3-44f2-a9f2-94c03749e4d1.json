            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nplatform/x86: wmi: Fix opening of char device\n\nSince commit fa1f68db6ca7 (\"drivers: misc: pass miscdevice pointer via\nfile private data\"), the miscdevice stores a pointer to itself inside\nfilp->private_data, which means that private_data will not be NULL when\nwmi_char_open() is called. This might cause memory corruption should\nwmi_char_open() be unable to find its driver, something which can\nhappen when the associated WMI device is deleted in wmi_free_devices().\n\nFix the problem by using the miscdevice pointer to retrieve the WMI\ndevice data associated with a char device using container_of(). This\nalso avoids wmi_char_open() picking a wrong WMI device bound to a\ndriver with the same name as the original driver.",
