            "description": "A vulnerability in ICMPv6 processing of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to improper processing of ICMPv6 messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted ICMPv6 messages to a targeted Cisco ASA or FTD system with IPv6 enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
