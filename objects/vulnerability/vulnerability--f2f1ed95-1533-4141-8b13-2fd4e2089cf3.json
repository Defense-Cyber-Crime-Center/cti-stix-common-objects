            "description": "The Product Table by WBW plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.1 via the 'saveCustomTitle' function. This is due to missing authorization and lack of sanitization of appended data in the languages/customTitle.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server.",
