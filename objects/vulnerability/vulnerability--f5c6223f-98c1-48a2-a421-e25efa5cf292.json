            "description": "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** In ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014), XSS occurs in /archibus/dwr/call/plaincall/workflow.runWorkflowRule.dwr because the data received as input from clients is re-included within the HTTP response returned by the application without adequate validation. In this way, if HTML code or client-side executable code (e.g., Javascript) is entered as input, the expected execution flow could be altered. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.",
