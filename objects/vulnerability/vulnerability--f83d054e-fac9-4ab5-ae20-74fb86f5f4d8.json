            "description": "The Ultimate Classified Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the update_profile function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify victim's email via a forged request, which might lead to account takeover, granted they can trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
