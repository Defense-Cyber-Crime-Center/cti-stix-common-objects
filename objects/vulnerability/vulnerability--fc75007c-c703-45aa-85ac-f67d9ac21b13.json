            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: s390: vsie: fix race during shadow creation\n\nRight now it is possible to see gmap->private being zero in\nkvm_s390_vsie_gmap_notifier resulting in a crash.  This is due to the\nfact that we add gmap->private == kvm after creation:\n\nstatic int acquire_gmap_shadow(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu,\n                               struct vsie_page *vsie_page)\n{\n[...]\n        gmap = gmap_shadow(vcpu->arch.gmap, asce, edat);\n        if (IS_ERR(gmap))\n                return PTR_ERR(gmap);\n        gmap->private = vcpu->kvm;\n\nLet children inherit the private field of the parent.",
