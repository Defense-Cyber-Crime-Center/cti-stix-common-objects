            "description": "An issue was found in the CPython `zipfile` module affecting versions 3.12.2, 3.11.8, 3.10.13, 3.9.18, and 3.8.18 and prior.\n\nThe zipfile module is vulnerable to “quoted-overlap” zip-bombs which exploit the zip format to create a zip-bomb with a high compression ratio. The fixed versions of CPython makes the zipfile module reject zip archives which overlap entries in the archive.\n\n",
